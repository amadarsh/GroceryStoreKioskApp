A product can have only one type of discount. The application will throw an error if the same product has more than 1 discount type.

Please make sure, each product is present in one type of catalog only.

Ex: In this case, Product 'Banana' with a product id as '1' either be in 'BOGODiscountCatalog.txt', 'GroupDiscountCatalog.txt' or 'RegularDiscountCatalog.txt' only.
